<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resist</li><li>Negative Resist</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The semiconductor resist market consists of two main types: positive resist and negative resist. Positive resist is a photosensitive material that becomes soluble when exposed to light, leaving behind the desired pattern when developed. It is commonly used in photolithography processes for generating patterns on silicon wafers. On the other hand, negative resist becomes insoluble upon exposure to light, meaning that the areas exposed remain during development. This type of resist is typically used for processes such as lift-off and direct writing, where a pattern is formed by removing the resist material in specific areas.</p></p>

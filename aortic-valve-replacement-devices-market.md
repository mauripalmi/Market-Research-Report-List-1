<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aortic Valve Replacement Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aortic valve replacement devices are used to treat aortic valve diseases. Open surgery involves the traditional approach where a large incision is made in the chest to access the heart and replace the damaged valve. On the other hand, minimally invasive surgery uses smaller incisions and specialized instruments to access the heart. This approach offers shorter recovery times, reduced scarring, and less pain compared to open surgery. Both types of surgeries aim to replace the damaged aortic valve with a prosthetic valve to restore normal blood flow.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Acting Gas Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Double Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double Acting Gas Boosters are devices used to increase the pressure of gases such as air and nitrogen. Single Stage Boosters have one piston and cylinder, allowing them to compress gas in one stroke. Double Stage Boosters, on the other hand, have two pistons and cylinders. In the first stage, gas is compressed by the first piston, then it is further compressed by the second piston in the second stage. This double stage arrangement allows for higher pressure ratios and better efficiency compared to single stage boosters.</p></p>

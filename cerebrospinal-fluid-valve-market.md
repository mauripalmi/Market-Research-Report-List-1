<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid valve market comprises two main types: fixed valves and adjustable valves. Fixed valves are designed to maintain a single, constant pressure within the brain by allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flow in one direction only. Adjustable valves, on the other hand, provide the ability to change the pressure settings as required, allowing customization for individual patients. These valves play a crucial role in managing conditions such as hydrocephalus by regulating the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system.</p></p>

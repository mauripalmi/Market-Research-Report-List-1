<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Delivery Equipment Gear Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Gear Pump</li><li>Internal Gear Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The liquid delivery equipment gear pumps market consists of two types: external gear pumps and internal gear pumps. External gear pumps are typically used for low to medium pressure applications and are suitable for transferring thin to highly viscous liquids. They work by rotating two external gears to create suction, drawing in the liquid and then forcing it out through the discharge port. On the other hand, internal gear pumps are commonly used for high-pressure applications and can handle a wide range of viscosities. They operate by rotating an external gear that meshes with an internal gear, trapping and transferring the liquid through the pump.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Cold Planers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel-type</li><li>Crawler-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road cold planers are machines used for removing asphalt and concrete from road surfaces. They are categorized into two types: wheel-type and crawler-type market. Wheel-type road cold planers are equipped with wheels allowing them to be easily maneuvered on paved surfaces. They are suited for smaller road milling projects. On the other hand, crawler-type road cold planers have tracks instead of wheels, providing them with better stability and maneuverability on rough terrains. They are commonly used for larger road milling projects or in challenging working conditions.</p></p>

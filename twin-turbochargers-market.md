<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin Turbochargers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tandem Turbo</li><li>Parallel Turbo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Twin turbochargers are a type of forced induction system used in automotive engines to increase power output. There are two main types of twin turbochargers: tandem turbo and parallel turbo. In a tandem turbo system, the exhaust gases flow through one turbocharger first and then into the second turbocharger, increasing air compression. On the other hand, a parallel turbo system has two turbochargers that work simultaneously, each connected to a separate set of cylinders. Both systems enhance engine performance, but their configurations slightly differ in terms of exhaust gas flow and turbocharger arrangement.</p></p>

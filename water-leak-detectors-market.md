<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Leak Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Leak Detector</li><li>Active Leak Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Water Leak Detectors market includes two types: Passive Leak Detectors and Active Leak Detectors. Passive Leak Detectors are devices that monitor water flow and pressure to detect any abnormal changes, such as a leak, and alert the user. They are effective for ongoing monitoring but require manual intervention. On the other hand, Active Leak Detectors actively control water flow by shutting off the main water supply when a leak is detected. This type offers immediate response and can prevent extensive damage caused by leaks. Both types cater to different needs and provide solutions for water leak detection.</p></p>

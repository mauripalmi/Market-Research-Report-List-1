<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Duct Air Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pleated Filter</li><li>Flat Filter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The duct air filters market comprises two main types: pleated filters and flat filters. Pleated filters have a higher filtration surface area due to their accordion-like design, which allows for increased capture of airborne particles. These filters are generally more efficient at removing dust, pollen, and other contaminants from the air. Flat filters, on the other hand, have a simpler design and are less effective in capturing smaller particles. Both types of filters are commonly used in HVAC systems to improve indoor air quality.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Treatment by Ion Implantation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ion Implantation</li><li>Plasma Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface treatment by ion implantation is a process used to modify the properties of materials by introducing ions into their surface. This process can be classified into two main types: ion implantation and plasma injection. Ion implantation involves bombarding the material's surface with high-energy ions, which penetrate into the material and alter its properties. On the other hand, plasma injection uses a plasma source to generate a plasma cloud containing the desired ions, which are then directed towards the material's surface to achieve the desired modifications.</p></p>

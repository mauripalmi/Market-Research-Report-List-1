<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Distribution Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distributed</li><li>Integrated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gas distribution systems can be classified into two main types: distributed market and integrated market. In a distributed market, the gas distribution network consists of multiple independent entities that are responsible for different parts of the system. This means that the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the infrastructure are divided among various companies. On the other hand, an integrated market involves a single organization that is responsible for all aspects of the gas distribution system, including ownership, operation, and maintenance. This centralized approach allows for coordination and efficiency in managing the gas distribution network.</p></p>

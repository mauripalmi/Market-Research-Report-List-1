<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Conductivity Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inductive Conductivity Sensor</li><li>Electrodeless Conductivity Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Water conductivity sensors are used to measure the ability of water to conduct electrical currents, which helps determine its purity and chemical composition. The inductive conductivity sensor type uses electromagnetic induction to measure conductivity and is suitable for high conductivity solutions. On the other hand, electrodeless conductivity sensors do not require direct contact with the water and instead use induced electromagnetic fields to measure conductivity. This type is useful for applications requiring non-intrusive and continuous monitoring. Both types of sensors offer accurate and efficient conductivity measurement solutions.</p></p>

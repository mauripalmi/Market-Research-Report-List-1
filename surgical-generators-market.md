<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Referenced Generators</li><li>Isolated Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical generators are medical devices used during surgical procedures to provide electrical power for various surgical tools. There are two types of surgical generators: ground referenced generators and isolated generators. Ground referenced generators have one side of their electrical output connected to the ground, while isolated generators have both sides of their electrical output isolated from the ground. Ground referenced generators are less safe as they can cause electrical shock, while isolated generators provide a safer working environment for surgeons and patients by minimizing the risk of electrical injuries.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coating Adhesion Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital Display</li><li>Analogue Display</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Coating adhesion testers are used to assess the strength of the bond between a coating and the surface it is applied to. There are two different market types available: digital display and analogue display. </p><p>Digital display testers provide a clear and precise reading of the adhesion value on a digital screen, making it easier for the user to interpret the results. On the other hand, analogue display testers use a traditional dial or needle gauge to show the adhesion value, which may require some estimation by the user. Both types serve the same purpose of evaluating coating adhesion but differ in the way the results are displayed.</p></p>

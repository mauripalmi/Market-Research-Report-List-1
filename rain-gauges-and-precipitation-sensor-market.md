<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rain Gauges and Precipitation Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tipping Bucket Type</li><li>Weighing Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rain gauges and precipitation sensors are used to measure the amount of rainfall or precipitation in a given area. There are two main types of rain gauges: tipping bucket and weighing type. Tipping bucket rain gauges work by collecting rainwater into a small container that tips and empties after a specific amount of rainfall is reached. Weighing type rain gauges, on the other hand, measure rainfall by weighing the water collected in a container. Both types serve the same purpose of accurately measuring precipitation levels for various applications and industries.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Friction Welding Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inertia Rotary Friction Welding</li><li>Direct Drive Rotary Friction Welding</li><li>Hybrid Rotary Friction Welding</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Rotary Friction Welding Machine market can be categorized into three types: Inertia Rotary Friction Welding, Direct Drive Rotary Friction Welding, and Hybrid Rotary Friction Welding. In Inertia Rotary Friction Welding, the rotational energy is stored in a flywheel and transferred to the workpiece, resulting in a friction-welded joint. Direct Drive Rotary Friction Welding, on the other hand, utilizes a motor to directly rotate and create friction between the workpieces. Hybrid Rotary Friction Welding combines elements of both inertia and direct drive methods to achieve superior welding results.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Veterinary X-ray System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Computed Radiography</li><li>Direct Radiography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital veterinary X-ray system market consists of two main types: Computed Radiography (CR) and Direct Radiography (DR). CR uses a cassette-based system to capture X-ray images, which are then processed digitally. DR, on the other hand, involves capturing X-ray images directly onto a digital detector, eliminating the need for cassettes. Both CR and DR have their own advantages and limitations, with DR typically offering higher image quality and faster image acquisition compared to CR.</p></p>

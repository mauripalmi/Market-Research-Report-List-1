<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stroke Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stroke treatment market can be divided into two main types: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of stroke cases and occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery in the brain, leading to a lack of blood supply and oxygen. Treatment for ischemic stroke involves removing or dissolving the clot. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and causes bleeding. This type of stroke requires immediate medical intervention to stop the bleeding and relieve pressure on the brain.</p></p>

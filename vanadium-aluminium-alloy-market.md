<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vanadium-aluminium Alloy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Purity</li><li>Low Purity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vanadium-aluminium alloys can be categorized into two main types based on their purity levels: high purity and low purity. High purity alloys are those that have a high concentration of vanadium and aluminium, with minimal impurities. These alloys are often used in applications where superior strength, corrosion resistance, and heat resistance are required. On the other hand, low purity alloys contain a higher proportion of impurities and are more cost-effective. They are typically used in less demanding applications where purity is not a critical factor.</p></p>

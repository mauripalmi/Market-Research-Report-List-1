<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Intrinsic safety modules are devices used to ensure safe operation of electrical equipment in hazardous environments. There are three main types of intrinsic safety modules: Zener Barriers, Isolator Barriers, and Converter Barriers. Zener Barriers regulate the voltage and limit the current to prevent ignition of explosive gases. Isolator Barriers provide galvanic isolation between hazardous and non-hazardous areas to prevent propagation of electrical faults. Converter Barriers convert signals between the hazardous and non-hazardous areas while maintaining intrinsic safety. These modules play a crucial role in the safe functioning of electrical systems in potentially explosive environments.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Linear Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting</li><li>Double-Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydraulic linear actuators are devices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical motion. There are two main types in the market: single-acting and double-acting actuators. Single-acting actuators use hydraulic pressure in one direction to extend the actuator rod. The return stroke is achieved through the use of external forces like gravity or springs. On the other hand, double-acting actuators use hydraulic pressure in both directions to extend and retract the actuator rod, providing more control and versatility in applications.</p></p>

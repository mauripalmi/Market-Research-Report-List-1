<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Rolling Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-torque Type</li><li>Torque Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric rolling motor market comprises two types: non-torque type and torque type. The non-torque type electric rolling motors are primarily used to drive roller blinds, curtains, and other simple rolling mechanisms. They focus on speed and precision rather than generating high torque. On the other hand, torque type electric rolling motors are designed to operate heavy rolling shutters, doors, gates, and other similar applications. These motors prioritize generating high torque to overcome the resistance and lift heavy loads with ease. Both types cater to different rolling mechanisms with varying requirements.</p></p>

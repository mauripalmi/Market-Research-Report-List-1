<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Desiccant Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intermittent Desiccant Dryer</li><li>Continuous Desiccant Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial desiccant dryer market can be categorized into two types: intermittent desiccant dryer and continuous desiccant dryer. Intermittent desiccant dryers operate in cycles, absorbing moisture from compressed air during the wet phase and regenerating the desiccant material during the dry phase. This type is suitable for industries with varying air demand. Continuous desiccant dryers, on the other hand, maintain a constant flow of dry air by employing two desiccant beds that are alternately regenerated. This type is ideal for industries requiring a consistent supply of dry air.</p></p>
